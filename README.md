# NXL Fund
Ethereum governance to manage an investment fund to purchase a pro sports franchise.

Ethereum contracts to set up a blockchain congress whose membership is controlled by a token vote.  The congress can perform any valid ethereum transaction as long as the number of congresspeople voting is greater than the quorum, and there are over 50% yea votes.  The head member of congress (the person receiving the most token votes) can veto any proposal that has less than 67% approval (this helps guard against hostile takeovers or late-spotted bugs in the proposed transaction).
